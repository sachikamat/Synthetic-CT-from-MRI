# Synthetic CT from MRI

The use of synthetic CT images generated from MR image data is increasing because they offer a number of potential advantages over traditional CT scans, including improved safety, greater detail, and the ability to generate 3D models for surgical planning.

This project was done to create a robust deep learning model which is capable of generating synthetic CT images from MR images. It is an implementation of  ["MR‚Äêbased synthetic CT generation using a deep convolutional neural network method." Medical physics 2017](https://sci-hub.se/10.1002/mp.12155)
